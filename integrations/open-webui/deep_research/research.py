# Web search results now come directly from OWUI's search_web() function.

_RELEVANCE_GATE_PROMPT = """\
You are a strict relevance AND credibility judge. Given a RESEARCH ANCHOR \
and a list of web search results, judge each result on TWO axes.

**Axis 1 — Relevance:**
- "relevant": addresses the anchor's topic area, key concepts, or must_cover \
items — even if only partially. A page title or snippet that mentions the \
core subject IS relevant. Err on the side of inclusion.
- "trail": tangentially related — about the broader field but not the \
specific topic. Also use for contrasting viewpoints or adjacent tools.
- "drop": completely off-topic, about a different subject entirely.

**Axis 2 — Source Authority (0.0–1.0):**
- 1.0: Official documentation, primary project source, RFC/spec
- 0.8: Established tech publications (MDN, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- 0.6: Reputable blog posts, Stack Overflow accepted answers
- 0.4: Forum posts, personal blogs, undated content
- 0.2: Content farms, AI-generated summaries, aggregator sites
- 0.0: Obvious spam, placeholder, or fabricated content

Return JSON array in the same order as the input:
[{{"index": 0, "verdict": "relevant"|"trail"|"drop", "authority": 0.0-1.0, \
"reason": "one sentence"}}]

IMPORTANT: You are judging based on short search snippets, not full articles. \
Be generous with relevance — if the title or snippet plausibly relates to the \
anchor, mark it "relevant". Only "drop" truly unrelated results.
Respond ONLY with valid JSON.\
"""

_EXTRACT_TOPICS_PROMPT = """\
You are a research strategist. Given a RESEARCH ANCHOR and a set of \
relevant sources that were just confirmed to match the user's query, \
extract:

1. **Deeper topics**: specific sub-topics, techniques, or terms mentioned \
IN the relevant sources that would yield even more targeted results if \
searched directly.
2. **Adjacent leads**: related topics from 'trail' sources that could \
connect to relevant material if pursued one level deeper.

Return JSON:
{{"deeper_terms": ["specific term from source content to search next"],
  "adjacent_leads": ["terms from trail sources worth pursuing"],
  "covered_so_far": ["anchor concepts now fully covered"]}}

Stay anchored \u2014 only suggest terms that serve the user's original query.\
"""

_PIVOT_PROMPT = """\
The previous web search returned NO results relevant to the RESEARCH ANCHOR.
Generate 3-5 completely different search terms to approach the topic from \
new angles. Strategies:
- Use different terminology or synonyms for the same concepts
- Search for the PROBLEM the user is trying to solve, not the solution
- Try specific authors, tools, frameworks, or competing projects
- Search for academic/research terms instead of marketing terms
- Try contrasting viewpoints: "limitations of X" or "alternatives to X"
- Do NOT just rephrase the same query \u2014 genuinely pivot

Return JSON: {{"terms": ["term1", "term2", "term3"], "strategy": "one sentence"}}\

_ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
Analyze collected web sources against the RESEARCH ANCHOR.

1. Summarize what the sources cover well.
2. Identify which specific aspects of the anchor are NOT yet \
addressed (gaps). Be precise \u2014 quote the anchor's must_cover items.
3. Assess source authority: note if ALL sources are from forums, blogs, \
or user-generated content with NO official documentation or primary \
project pages. If so, flag "missing_official_sources" as a gap.
4. Suggest search terms that would specifically fill those gaps. If \
official sources are missing, include terms like \
"<project> official documentation" or "<project> getting started guide".

Return JSON:
